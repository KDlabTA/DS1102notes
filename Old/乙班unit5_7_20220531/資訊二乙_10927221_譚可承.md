**1.** **Functions**
**2.** **Collision Resolutions**

- **Functions**

    - Simple hash functions on positive integers
        1. Digit selection
        2. Folding
        3. Modulo arithmetic
            - The table size should be prime

- **Collision Resolutions**

    - 1.Open addressing
        - Probe for an empty location in the hash table
        - As the hash table fills, collisions increase
        - Increase of table size
            - Need to hash the items again
    
    - 2.Restructuring the hash table
        - Allows the hash table to accommodate more than 
          one item in the same location

    - a. Linear probing
        - Search the first location and then the next etc.
        - Primary clustering problem
            - Items tend to cluster together and large clusters tend to get even larger
            - Large clusters cause long probing sequences (sequential search)
        - Deletion problem
            - Empty locations after deletions would incorrectly stop a probing sequence

    - b. Quadratic probing
        - Search the first location and then continue at the increments of 12, 22, 32, and so on
        - Probing sequence may not visit every location in the hash table
        - Secondary clustering problem
            - Different keys at the same location create the same probing sequence
        - Table size must be prime
            - Fewer alternate locations if it is not prime
            
    - c. Double hashing
        - table size vs. step size
            - If they are relatively prime, the probing sequence will visit every location in the hash table

    - Restructuring the hash table
        1. Buckets
            - Each location in the hash table is itself an array
        2. Separate chaining
            - Each hash table location is a linked list
            - Successfully resolves collisions
            - The size of the hash table is dynamic

### 大綱:

**1.** **Terminologies**
**2.** **Representations**
**3.** **Traversals**
**4.** **DFS and BFS Traversals**

- **Terminologies**

    - Undirected graph
    - Directed graph (digraph)
    - Adjacent vertices
    - Edge is incident incident to vertices
    - Path: a sequence of edges
    - Cycle: begin & end at the same vertex
    - Simple path: a path that passes through any vertex only once
    - Simple cycle: a cycle that passes through the other vertices only once

- **Representations**

    - Most common implementations of a graph
        1. Adjacency matrix Adjacency matrix
        2. Adjacency lis

    - Adjacency matrix for a graph that has n vertices  numbered 0, 1, …, n – 1
        - An n by n array matrix such that matrix[i][j] indicates whether an edge exists from vertex i tovertex j

    - Two common operations on graphs
        1. Determine whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j
        2. Find all vertices adjacent to a given vertex i

    - Adjacency matrix
        - Supports operation 1 more efficiently

    - Adjacency list
        - Supports operation 2 more efficiently
        - Often requires less space than an adjacency matrix

- **Traversals**

    - Visits all the vertices that it can reach
    
    - Visits all vertices of the graph if and only if the graph is connected
        - A connected component connected component : 
            The subset of vertices visited during a traversal that begins at a given vertex
            
    - To prevent indefinite loops (break the cycles)
        - Mark each vertex during a visit
        - Never visit a vertex more than once

- **DFS and BFS Traversals**
    
    - Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal
        - Proceeds along a path from a vertex v as deeply into the graph as possible before backing up
        - A “last visited, first explored” strategy
        - Has a simple recursive recursive form
        - Has an iterative iterative form that uses a stack

    - Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal
        - Visit every vertex adjacent to a vertex v before visiting any other vertex
        - A “first visited, first explored” strategy
        - An iterative iterative form uses a queue
        - A recursive form is possible, but not simple

    - Summary
        - The most common implementations of a graph use either an adjacency matrix adjacency matrix or adjacency list adjacency list
        - Graph searching
            - Depth-first search first search goes as deep into the graph as it can before backtracking
                - Uses a stack
            - Bread-first search first search visits all possible adjacent vertices before traversing further into the graph
                - Uses a queue

**3.** **Shortest Paths**

- **Topological Sort**

    - Topological order
        - A list of vertices in a directed graph without cycles directed graph without cycles(Acyclic Digraph or Directed Acyclic Graph, DAG) Directed Acyclic Graph, DAG such that vertex x precedes vertex y if there is a directed edge from x to y in the graph
        - Several topological orders are possible for a given graph

        - Arranging the vertices into a topological order
        ![](https://img.onl/b3P0q1)
        
    - topSort1 topSort
        1. Find a vertex that has no successor (out-degree=0)
        2. Add the vertex to the beginning of a list 
        3. Remove that vertex from the graph, as well as all edges that lead to it
        4. Repeat the previous steps until the graph is empty
            -  When the loop ends, the list of vertices will be in topological order topological order

    - topSort2
        - A modification of the iterative DFS iterative DFS algorithm
        - Push all vertices that have no predecessor onto a stack
        - Each time you pop a vertex from the stack, add it to the beginning of a list of vertices
        - When the traversal ends, the list of vertices will be in topological order

- **Spanning Tree**

    - A tree is an undirected connected connected graph without cycles ( without cycles (acyclic acyclic)

    - A spanning tree spanning tree of a connected undirected graph G is

        - A subgraph of G that contains all of G’s vertices vertices and enough of its edges to form a tree
        - Application example: communication network

    - To obtain a spanning spanning tree from a connected undirected graph with cycles
        - Remove edges until there are no cycles

    - Detecting a cycle in an undirected connected graph
        - DFS or BFS?
        - A connected undirected graph that has n vertices must have at least at least n – 1 edges 1 edges
        - A connected undirected graph that has n vertices and exactly exactly n – 1 edges 1 edges cannot contain a cycle
        - A connected undirected graph that has n vertices and more than more than n – 1 edges 1 edges must contain at least one cycle

    - To create a spanning tree
        - Traverse the graph using either depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) and mark the edges that you follow
        - After the traversal is completed, the graph’s vertices and marked edges form a spanning tree

- **Shortest Paths**

    - Shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph is the path that has the the path that has the smallest sum smallest sum of its edge weights edge weights

    - Problem definition
        - Find the shortest paths between a given origin and all other vertices

    - Basic idea
        - A set vertexSet vertexSet of selected vertices
        - An array weight, where weight[v] is the cheapest weight of the shortest path from vertex 0 (origin) to vertex v that passes through only the vertices in vertexSet vertexSet
        ![](https://img.onl/LWbwZW)
